# ajax-api-wonderment

## Intro

In this project, we had to have an array of items around a theme:
* the items items in the array would automatically create and populate their own buttons. 
* If a button was clicked, 10 gif's would populate below with the rating
* The gif would populate in the still state and would animate once clicked and pause again when clicked again.
* There will be an area where the user can type in their own word, and a button will appear with the user's word.
* Pressing that new button, gif's would appear.
